## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes various features that influence house prices:

- `area`: Size of the house in square feet
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `stories`: Number of floors
- `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, etc.: Categorical features indicating various amenities
- `furnishingstatus`: Whether the house is furnished
- `price`: Target variable (selling price)

## 📈 Model Building Steps

1. **Import Libraries & Dataset**
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection
3. **Train-Test Split**
4. **Model Training (Linear Regression)**
5. **Prediction & Evaluation**
   - R² Score
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Visualization (actual vs predicted)
